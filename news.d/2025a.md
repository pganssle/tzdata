## Briefly:

Paraguay adopts permanent -03 starting spring 2024. Improve pre-1991 data for
the Philippines. Etc/Unknown is now reserved.

## Changes to future timestamps

Paraguay will stop changing its clocks after the spring-forward transition on
2024-10-06, so it is now permanently at -03. (Thanks to Heitor David Pinto and
Even Scharning.) This affects timestamps starting 2025-03-22, as well as the
obsolescent tm_isdst flags starting 2024-10-15.

## Changes to past timestamps

Correct timestamps for the Philippines before 1900, and from 1937 through 1990.
(Thanks to P Chan for the heads-up and citations.) This includes adjusting local
mean time before 1899; fixing transitions in September 1899, January 1937, and
June 1954; adding transitions in December 1941, November 1945, March and
September 1977, and May and July 1990; and removing incorrect transitions in
March and September 1978.

## Changes to data

Add zone1970.tab lines for the Concordia and Eyre Bird Observatory research
stations.  (Thanks to Derick Rethans and Jule Dabars.)

## Changes to documentation

The name Etc/Unknown is now reserved: it will not be used by TZDB. This is for
compatibility with CLDR, which uses the string "Etc/Unknown" for an unknown or
invalid timezone.  (Thanks to Justin Grant, Mark Davis, and Guy Harris.)
